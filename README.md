# 🚀 12 Projects in 12 Months

*Because who needs sleep when you have deadlines?* 😴

Three builders. Twelve months. Infinite coffee. ☕ We're shipping one project every single month for an entire year. No excuses. No delays. Just pure, unadulterated shipping velocity. 🏃‍♂️💨

## 🎯 What We're Doing

We're on a mission to build **12 projects in 12 months**. That's one project per month. Every month. No exceptions. It's ambitious, it's exhausting, and it's absolutely worth it.

Each project is a complete, shipped product. No half-baked ideas. No "coming soon" pages. Just real, working software that solves real problems (or at least looks cool trying).

## 🎨 What We Build

We build everything. Web apps, mobile apps, developer tools, AI experiments, SaaS products—you name it, we'll probably build it. The only rule? It has to ship. No exceptions.

Each project is:
- 🚢 **Shipped** - Not a prototype, not a demo, a real product
- 🎯 **Focused** - One clear purpose, executed well
- 📝 **Documented** - Because we're not monsters
- 🎉 **Fun** - Life's too short to build boring things

## 💡 Got Ideas?

We're always looking for the next project to build! Head over to our [dashboard](https://12in12-dashboard.vercel.app) and vote on ideas. Your vote could be the difference between us building a productivity app or a cat meme generator. Choose wisely. 🐱

Also if you have an idea, we are happy if you reach out.

## 🎯 Our Goals

- ✅ Ship 12 projects in 12 months (obviously)

- ✅ Have fun (this is non-negotiable)

## 📈 The Journey

Follow along as we:
- 🏗️ Build in public
- 📝 Share what we learn

## 🙏 Why We're Doing This

Because building is fun. Because shipping is addictive. Because we wanted to see if we could actually do it.

*Built with ❤️, ☕, and questionable life choices.*

**Remember**: Shipping > Perfection. Always. 🚢

*P.S. - If you see us looking tired, it's because we are. But we're having the time of our lives. 😅*
